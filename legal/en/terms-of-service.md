We may suspend or terminate your access at any time if:
- you materially breach these Terms or fail to pay fees;
- your use creates security or legal risk; or

You may terminate by cancelling your Account. Upon termination, your access will cease and you remain responsible for outstanding fees. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 7-18) will survive.

## 15. Disclaimer
The Services are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, ToldYou and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages (including loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill) arising from your use of the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or related to the Services will not exceed the greater of: (a) the amounts paid by you to ToldYou in the 12 months preceding the claim, or (b) NT$10,000.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of liability, so certain limitations may not apply to you.
