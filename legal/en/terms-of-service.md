**Last Updated:** 5 November 2025

Thank you for choosing ToldYou Button. These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between you and ToldYou, Ltd. ("ToldYou", "we", "us", or "our") regarding your access to and use of the ToldYou Button widget, dashboard, website, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Definitions
- **Customer**: The individual or entity that registers for or uses the ToldYou Button widget.
- **Customer Content**: Any text, graphics, links, media, or other materials that a Customer submits, configures, or makes available through the Services, including destination links for messaging channels.
- **End User**: Visitors that interact with the ToldYou Button widget embedded on a Customer's website or mobile property.
- **Free Service**: The ToldYou Button P1 service currently offered at no charge, whose business model includes a visible backlink (e.g., the "報數據" label) pointing to our designated website.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 18 years old or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction to use the Services. By using the Services, you affirm that you meet this requirement and, if you use the Services on behalf of an organization, that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.

## 3. Changes to the Services and Terms
We may modify the Services or these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated by posting an updated version with a revised "Last Updated" date or by other reasonable notice. Continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 4. Service Registration and Communications
Registering for the P1 Free Service only requires a valid email address. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information. You agree that we may send service-related codes and notices to the email address you provide.

## 5. Service Plans and Future Changes
1. **Free Service**: The P1 stage of the Services is currently provided at no charge. As consideration for using the Free Service, you agree that the installed widget will display a visible backlink (e.g., with the "報數據" anchor text) pointing to a website designated by ToldYou (e.g., thinkwithblack.com). You agree not to hide, obscure, or remove this backlink by any means, including CSS or JavaScript.
2. **Future Plans**: We reserve the right to introduce Paid Plans in the future. Pricing, features, and payment terms will be announced separately at that time.
3. **Service Adjustments**: We may modify or discontinue the Free Service at any time.

## 6. Use of the Services
- You are responsible for configuring the widget, providing accurate platform links, and ensuring that Customer Content complies with all applicable laws and platform policies.
- You must obtain all necessary rights and consents to share End Users' personal data with us or messaging platforms.
- We may rate-limit, throttle, or suspend access to prevent misuse, protect system integrity, or comply with legal obligations.

## 7. Customer Content
You retain ownership of Customer Content. By submitting Customer Content, you grant ToldYou a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display, and distribute the content solely as needed to provide the Services. You represent and warrant that Customer Content:
- does not infringe any third-party rights;
- is accurate and lawful;
- does not contain malicious code or deceptive links; and
- complies with our Acceptable Use requirements in Section 8.

## 8. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
1. use the Services for spam, scams, phishing, or other deceptive practices;
2. misrepresent the origin of messages or impersonate another person or brand without permission;
3. probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any ToldYou system without written authorization;
4. interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services;
5. use the Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or unlawful content;
6. use automated tools to scrape, export, or harvest data in violation of privacy rules;
7. reverse engineer or attempt to derive the source code of the Services except to the extent allowed by law;
8. resell, sublicense, or frame the Services without our prior written consent;
9. remove, obscure, hide, or modify the backlink included in the Free Service (e.g., the "報數據" link).

We may investigate and take action, including suspension or termination, if we suspect violations of these Terms or abuse reports.

## 9. Third-Party Services
The Services may integrate with or link to third-party platforms (e.g., LINE, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp). ToldYou does not control these platforms and is not responsible for their terms, privacy practices, or functionality. You are solely responsible for complying with third-party terms and acquiring necessary permissions.

## 10. Intellectual Property
The Services, including all software, trademarks, logos, and content provided by ToldYou, are owned by or licensed to ToldYou and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. Except for the limited rights expressly granted in these Terms, no other rights are conveyed. You may not use our branding without written permission.

## 11. Feedback
If you provide feedback or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use that feedback without restriction or compensation.

## 12. Confidentiality
"Confidential Information" means non-public information disclosed by one party to the other that is designated as confidential or reasonably should be understood to be confidential. Each party will protect the other's Confidential Information using reasonable care and not disclose it to third parties, except as required to provide the Services or comply with law.

## 13. Data Protection
Use of the Services is subject to our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) which explains how we process personal data. Customers must provide required notices and obtain consents from End Users whose data is processed through the Services.

## 14. Suspension and Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access at any time if:
- you materially breach these Terms;
- your use creates security or legal risk; or
- we discontinue the Services.
You may terminate by ceasing to use the Services (for example, by removing the widget code from your site). Upon termination, your access will cease. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 7-18) will survive.

## 15. Disclaimer
The Services are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation, nor that the Services will meet your requirements.

## 16. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, ToldYou and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages (including loss of profits, revenues, data, or goodwill) arising from your use of the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because the P1 stage of the Services is provided free of charge, our total liability for any claim arising out of or related to the Services will not exceed NT$1,000.

## 17. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ToldYou, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your Customer Content, your use of the Services, or your breach of these Terms.

These Terms are governed by the laws of Taiwan (Republic of China), without regard to conflict of law principles. The Taipei District Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes arising from or relating to these Terms, except that either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any jurisdiction to protect intellectual property or Confidential Information.

## 19. Force Majeure
We are not liable for delays or failures to perform due to events beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, power failures, telecommunications outages, governmental actions, pandemics, or labor disputes.

## 20. Assignment
You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of assets.
