# ToldYou Button Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 5 November 2025

Think with Black Co., Ltd. ("ToldYou", "we", "us", or "our") operates the ToldYou Button widget, dashboard, and related services (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information when you visit our website or use the Services. By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use.

This Privacy Policy supplements the [ToldYou Button Terms of Service](./terms-of-service.md).

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect information from two categories of individuals:
- **Customers**: Website owners or businesses who configure the ToldYou Button widget.
- **End Users**: Visitors who interact with the widget embedded on a Customer’s website.

### 1.1 Information You Provide to Us
- **Service Registration**: Email address, language preference you select, and the button configuration content (Config JSON) you submit.
- **Communications**: Messages you send to our support team, survey responses, or other feedback.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
- **Usage Data**: Log files, IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and timestamps.
- **Device Data**: Device identifiers, operating system, screen size, and network provider.
- **Cookies & Similar Technologies**: We use cookies, local storage, and scripts to remember preferences and analyze traffic. You can control cookies via browser settings; disabling cookies may limit functionality.

### 1.3 End User Data
When End Users click messaging buttons configured by the Customer, we may process the identifiers that the Customer provides (e.g., LINE ID, Messenger Page name, Instagram handle, WhatsApp number, phone number, email address). We do not store chat transcripts between Customers and End Users. For analytics and security, we may log event metadata (e.g., button clicked, timestamp, IP address). Customers are responsible for obtaining any required consent from End Users before submitting their data to us.

## 2. How We Use Information
We use collected information to:
1. Provide, maintain, and improve the Services.
2. Authenticate users and secure accounts.
3. Deliver the requested embed code and service notifications.
4. Respond to support requests and communicate important updates.
5. Analyze usage, monitor performance, and prevent abuse.
6. Comply with applicable laws, regulations, and legal processes.

## 3. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK users)
If you reside in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, our processing is based on the following legal grounds:
- Performance of a contract (to provide the Services).
- Legitimate interests (to secure and improve the Services, communicate with you, and detect fraud).
- Compliance with legal obligations.
- Consent (for optional cookies, marketing communications, or when Customers rely on consent to provide End User data).

## 4. Sharing of Information
We do not sell personal data. We share information with:
- **Service Providers**: Hosting (e.g., Vercel, Neon), email distribution (e.g., Resend, SendGrid), analytics, and payment processors who process data on our behalf under appropriate agreements.
- **Messaging Platforms**: When a Customer configures the widget, we direct End Users to third-party messaging services (e.g., LINE, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp). Interactions on those platforms are governed by their own policies.
- **Professional Advisors & Authorities**: Legal, accounting, and compliance partners when required by law or to protect our rights.
- **Business Transfers**: In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, subject to confidentiality safeguards.

## 5. Data Retention
We retain Customer data for as long as you use the Services or as needed to provide them. Configuration records and logs may be retained for legal, security, and accounting requirements. We retain End User event metadata for up to 24 months unless a shorter period is required by law or a Customer requests deletion sooner (subject to legitimate interests).

## 6. International Transfers
We operate in Taiwan and may process data in other countries where we or our service providers maintain facilities. When transferring personal data internationally, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful mechanisms.

## 7. Security
We employ technical and organizational measures—such as encryption in transit, access controls, and regular security reviews—to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is entirely secure; use the Services at your own risk.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete your personal data.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.
- Receive a copy of your data in a portable format.
- Withdraw consent where we rely on consent.

To exercise these rights, contact us at **privacy@toldyou.co**. We will respond to verified requests within a reasonable timeframe. If you are an End User, please contact the Customer directly; we will support the Customer in fulfilling your request where required.

### Marketing Communications
We may send newsletters or announcements. You can opt out at any time using the unsubscribe link or by contacting us.

### Cookies
Most browsers let you refuse cookies or alert you when a cookie is being placed. Some essential cookies cannot be disabled because they are necessary for the Services to function.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us so we can delete it.

## 10. Third-Party Links
The Services may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their policies before providing any personal data.

## 11. Updates to this Privacy Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced by revising the "Last Updated" date and, when appropriate, providing additional notice. Continued use of the Services means you accept the updated Policy.
